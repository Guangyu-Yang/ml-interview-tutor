# ML Interview Tutor 🎓🤖

An interactive AI tutor powered by Claude Code that helps you prepare for machine learning interviews using the Socratic method.

## Features

- **Socratic Method**: Assesses what you know before teaching
- **Concise Explanations**: ~200 word explanations that respect your time
- **Active Learning**: Verifies understanding with follow-up questions
- **Adaptive Teaching**: Adjusts difficulty based on your responses
- **Progress Tracking**: Remembers your strengths and areas to review

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or Claude CLI
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Guangyu-Yang/ml-interview-tutor.git
   cd ml-interview-tutor
   ```

2. Open with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. Start learning! Try:
   - "Quiz me on gradient descent"
   - "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff"
   - "Help me understand attention mechanisms"
   - "Practice a ML system design question"

## ML Interview Topics Covered

### Fundamentals
- Linear algebra, probability, statistics
- Gradient descent & optimization
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Regularization (L1, L2, dropout)
- Cross-validation & evaluation metrics

### Classical ML
- Linear/logistic regression
- Decision trees & random forests
- SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
- Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

### Deep Learning
- Neural network architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN, Transformer)
- Backpropagation
- Activation functions
- Batch normalization, layer normalization
- Attention mechanisms

### NLP
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
- Transformers & BERT
- Language models & fine-tuning

### ML Systems & Design
- Feature engineering
- Training pipelines
- Model serving & inference
- A/B testing
- Handling data drift

### Practical ML
- Debugging models
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Dealing with imbalanced data
- Scaling & distributed training

## How It Works

1. **Assess**: Asks what you already know about the topic
2. **Explain**: Provides a concise, interview-focused explanation
3. **Verify**: Asks follow-up questions (like an interviewer would)
4. **Adapt**: Goes deeper or reviews basics based on your answers
5. **Track**: Updates your profile for personalized sessions

## Customization

Edit `memory/learner-profile.md` to:
- Set target companies/roles
- Mark topics you're confident in
- Flag areas needing review
- Track mock interview performance

## Interview Prep Tips

- Practice explaining concepts out loud
- Use the "teach back" technique
- Focus on intuition, not just formulas
- Be ready to discuss trade-offs
- Know your projects deeply
